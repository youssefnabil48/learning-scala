1. why in scala 3 this gives an error in type members:

      trait MList {
        type A <: Number
        def head: A
        def tail: MList
      }

      class IntList(hd: Int, tl: IntList) extends MList {
        type A = Int
        def head = hd
        def tail = tl
      }

2. variance overall
3. why is it called f-bounded polymorphism>
